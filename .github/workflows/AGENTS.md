# AGENTS.md

GitHub Actions workflows for CI, release automation, and policy checks.

## Scope

- This file governs edits in `.github/workflows/*.yml`.
- Keep one top-level triggered workflow per CI intent:
  - `feature-ci.yml` for non-`master` push CI
  - `master-ci.yml` for merged-PR-to-`master` release CI
- Keep OS/platform splits in reusable workflows invoked via `workflow_call`.

## Current workflow map

- `feature-ci.yml` -> orchestrator for feature branch CI.
- `feature-linux.yml` -> reusable Linux build/test/package workflow.
- `feature-windows.yml` -> reusable Windows build/test/package workflow.
- `master-pr-title-guard.yml` -> validates semantic-prefix policy for PRs targeting `master`.
- `master-ci.yml` -> orchestrator for merged PRs into `master`.
- `master-windows.yml` -> reusable Windows build/test/package workflow for master release flow.

## CI invariants (do not break)

1. Keep workflow intent stable:
   - feature workflows produce branch+sha artifacts
   - master workflows produce semver-tagged release artifacts
2. Do not duplicate top-level triggers for the same intent.
3. Preserve artifact naming conventions:
   - `tcg-game-tracker-linux-<version>.zip`
   - `tcg-game-tracker-windows-<version>.zip`
   - `tcg-game-tracker-windows-installer-<version>` (feature) and `.exe` (master release asset)
4. Preserve embedded app version wiring via `-DTRACKER_APP_VERSION=...` in both feature and master build flows.
5. Keep `master` release flow gated to merged PRs only.
6. Keep PR title prefix policy aligned with `scripts/compute_master_semver.sh`.

## Editing rules

- Prefer minimal, surgical edits; avoid large workflow rewrites unless requested.
- Reusable workflows should declare explicit `workflow_call` inputs for required context.
- Keep `permissions` least-privilege.
- Keep shells consistent with runner setup (bash on Linux, `msys2 {0}` on Windows).

## Required follow-ups

- After changing workflow topology, update `docs/ci-cd-guide.md`.
- If artifact names or release behavior change, update `docs/ci-cd-guide.md` and `docs/versioning.md`.
- If adding/removing workflow files, update this file's "Current workflow map".

## Anti-patterns

- Do not add a second top-level feature or master trigger file.
- Do not introduce MSVC-specific build commands; project CI targets Clang/MinGW toolchains.
- Do not silently change artifact names.
